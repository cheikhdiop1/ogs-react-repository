## Assignment1 - Setup, TopBar

**Description**: 
The initial task was to create a fully functional navigation bar (`TopBar`) for a web application using React. This included setting up a new React project, clearing and reorganizing the `src` and `public` directories, and configuring essential files. The `TopBar` component was designed with responsive features using React Bootstrap, including a side menu with dynamic interactions. Functionality was added to dynamically adjust the opacity based on the window's scroll position using `useState` and `useEffect`. The navigation system was integrated using `react-router-dom` to manage active state highlighting based on the current route. Extensive CSS was applied to ensure the UI is visually appealing and functional. Debugging and enhancements were performed to ensure all components interacted seamlessly.
