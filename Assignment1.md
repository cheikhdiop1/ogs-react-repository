# Assignment 1 Summary

## Objective
The main purpose of Assignment 1 was to develop a `TopBar` component with a side menu featuring animations and dynamic interactions. This component serves as a crucial part of the user interface, providing navigation functionality throughout the application.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. **Create a New React App**
- Initialized the project using `npx create-react-app`, which set up the necessary project structure and dependencies.

### 2. **Clean Directories**
- Cleared all contents from the `src` and `public` directories to start from scratch, ensuring no residual files affected the new development.

### 3. **Recreate Essential Files**
- Recreated essential files like `index.html` and `index.js` necessary for the React app's operation.

### 4. **Establish Folder Structure**
- Organized the project by creating specific folders for components and pages within the `src` directory.

### 5. **Develop TopBar Component**
- Created the `TopBar` component using React Bootstrap, which includes a responsive navbar with a side menu. This component also features dynamic animations for menu item interactions.

### 6. **Dynamic Opacity in TopBar**
- Implemented functionality to adjust the opacity of the `TopBar` based on the scroll position using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

### 7. **Navigation Active State Management**
- Managed the active state of navigation items using `useState` and `useLocation` from `react-router-dom`, highlighting the currently active page.

### 8. **Styling and CSS Modules**
- Applied CSS modules for component-specific styling, ensuring local scope of styles and enhancing UI elements like transitions and hover effects.

### 9. **React Router Integration**
- Configured React Router for effective page navigation, linking various components through the `TopBar`.

### 10. **Background Image on Home Page**
- Added a fixed background image on the homepage that stays stationary as the content scrolls, providing a visually appealing user experience.

### 11. **Debugging and Enhancements**
- Conducted thorough debugging and made necessary adjustments to ensure functionalities such as the dynamic opacity and active state updates performed correctly.
